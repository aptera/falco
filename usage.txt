falco: Sanitary pair and mob programming for the modern age

    start               Begin a mob programming session 
                        from the current branch.

    pass                Handoff the work in progress to the 
                        git repo, so another driver can take over.

    driver              Pull down the work in progress from the 
                        git repo to begin driving more changes.

    commit <message>    Commit and squash merge all changes from the 
                        session back into the original working branch. 
                        This ends the mobbing session.

    clean               When another driver commits the work from the 
                        session, other drivers from the session can
                        run this to clean up the session locally.

    stop                Aborts the mobbing session and resets the local
                        environment.
